# AMKSR-for-SAR-ATR

Note that due to the fact that the sizes of the used data sets are relatively large, we also provide an additional download link for these data sets at https://pan.baidu.com/data sets. After downloading the data sets to the same directory as the source code, you can directly run the source code of AMKSR on different data sets to verify the recognition results of AMKSR.

The demo.m provides a case study about the entire training and test process of the developed AMKSR algorithm. 

Due to the fact that the training time under various scenarios is quite time-consuming, for the convenience of the reviewer to verify the recogniiton results, we directly give the test process under various scenarios. Specifically, AMKSR_SOC, AMKSR_EOC_1, AMKSR_EOC_2, AMKSR_EOC_3, AMKSR_SAMPLE, and AMKSR_ACD are separatey used to verify the test results under SOC, EOC-1, EOC-2, EOC-3, SAMPLE, and SAR-ACD.
