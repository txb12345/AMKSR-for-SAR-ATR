# AMKSR-for-SAR-ATR

Note that the reviewer should first download the data sets under various scenarios to the same directory as the source code. Then, the reviewer can run the source code of AMKSR on different data sets to verify the recognition results of AMKSR.

The demo.m provides a case study about the entire training and test process of AMKSR. 

Due to the fact that the training time under various scenarios is quite time-consuming, for the convenience of the reviewer to verify the recogniiton results, we directly give the test process under various scenarios. Specifically, AMKSR_SOC, AMKSR_EOC_1, AMKSR_EOC_2, AMKSR_EOC_3, AMKSR_SAMPLE, and AMKSR_ACD are separatey used to verify the test results under SOC, EOC-1, EOC-2, EOC-3, SAMPLE, and SAR-ACD.
